# Tasks: (1) Access two core R data sets                         #
#        (2) Illustrate the data's distribution with descriptive #
#            statistics                                          #
#        (3) Link two files dynamically                          #
#        (4) Make a pull request (not found in this code)        #
# The following code will analyze data set "women" of R Studio   #
# concerning the tasks as mentioned above.                       #

# Part 2: Second data set analysis

# The following code was produced with one of
# the internal data sets of R Studio in order
# to be easily reproducible.

# Run a dynamically linked file to list all availabale internal data sets of R Studio
source("Linked_Code_List_Datasets")

# Load data set
data(women)

# View information about the chosen data set
?women

# Information about the data set:
# This data set gives the average heights
# and weights for American women aged 30â€“39.

# In the following we perform some basic descriptive
# statistics. More to follow!

# List variable names (height & weight)
names(women)

# Before we start the analysis, we check if there are
# any values missing
is.na(women)

# To get an overview of the structure of the data set
# we are looking at, we first use the command 'str'
str(women)

# Create a labeled table to get an overview of all observations
library(Hmisc)
label(women[[1]]) <- "Woman's Height"
label(women[[2]]) <- "Woman's Weight"
View(women)

# List min., 1st qu., median, mean, 3rd qu. and max.
summary(women)

# Create histrogram showing height of women
hist(women$height,
     main='Height of observed Women',
     xlab='In inches')
     
# Create histogram showing weight of women
hist(women$weight,
     main='Weight of observed Women',
     xlab='In lbs')
     
# Create boxplot for relation between height and weight
plot(women$height, women$weight,
     main='Height and weight of observed women',
     xlab='In inches',
     ylab='In lbs')

# Comment from the authors:
# As this is our first experience in coding,
# we are happy to receive feedback from
# anyone out there!
