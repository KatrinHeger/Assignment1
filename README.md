# Pair Assignment 1

Hello world,

This is the working repository for our first pair assignment in our class in "Introduction to Social Science Data Analysis" at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. Basically, the goal of the class is to learn how to collaboratively create reproducible analysis of publicly available data with the statistical language R.

For our first assignment, the tasks were as follows:

(1) Access two core R data sets
(2) Illustrate the data's distribution with descriptive statistics
(3) Link two files dynamically
(4) Make a pull request to another team's assignment

Concerning (1) and (2), we chose two internal data sets of R Studio, namely "trees", describing measurements of the girth, height and volume of timber in 31 felled black cherry trees, as well as "women", describing the average heights and weights for women aged 30â€“39 in the USA. To do so, we wrote code to describe the data set itself, such as its structure and a list of all observations, as well as the creation of several histograms and boxplots describing the data sets. In addition, we also tested for some correlations.

Concerning (4), we created a pull request to another class mate to add the citation of the R software being used.

We are happy to receive any feedback and invite everyone to make pull requests to our code!

Best,

Katrin and Benedikt
